        <!--
        Emphasis in MINIMUM: What is the simplest way to reproduce the bug?
        Avoid things like "Create a kubernetes cluster", or anything related with cloud providers, as that is rarely the root cause and the bug may be closed as "not reproducible".
        If you can provide a simple docker compose config, that's even better.
